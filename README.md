## Introduction

This repository provides the code necessary to process and utilize the USCILab3D Dataset, a large-scale, long-term outdoor dataset. The dataset and associated tools are designed for research and development in the fields of computer vision, SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), and AI.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories, each with its own README:

- **vision_toolkit**: Contains code for processing raw bagfiles, creating SLAM info, dividing sectors, and running COLMAP.
- **3d2d_ann**: Contains code related to GPT-4, Grounded-SAM, and projection.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/USCILab3D-Dataset.git
cd USCILab3D-Dataset
# Follow the installation instructions in each subdirectory's README
